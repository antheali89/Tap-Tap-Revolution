INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING GAME

1. go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install the 2.7.3 version (scroll way down).  After running the installer, you should have IDLE in your All Programs folder in your start menu.  Install the 32-bit Python version regardless of the type of your computer (due to complications with pygame).

2. Launch IDLE.  To test if Python was installed correctly, type in print 1+1 if it outputs 2, then Python has been installed correctly.

3. go to: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml and download the 2.7 release of pygame for Windows (named pygame-1.9.1.win32-py2.7.msi)

4. To verify that pygame is installed properly, type import pygame into IDLE.  If this doesn’t result in any output, then you’re good.

5. In IDLE, go to File > Open and click AntheaLiDDR.py 

6. Go to Run > Run Module (or press F5) to run the program.

NOTE:
When running the game, there are two windows that pop up titled: *Python 2.7.13 Shell* and pygame window. In order to close and stop the program, you must close the *Python 2.7.13 Shell* window and click “OK” on the dialogue box that pops up.  For some reason, nothing happens when you just click the “X” button.

HOW TO PLAY GAME:
When the animated arrows roll across the screen, press your arrow keys at the moment the corresponding animated arrow matches up with the white arrow.  For example, if there’s a left pointing arrow moving across the screen, at the moment when the moving arrow matches up with the stationary white arrow, press the left arrow key on your keyboard.  
As you get more accurate with your key pressing timing, your points will increase with every press!
Press your space bar to pause the game.
